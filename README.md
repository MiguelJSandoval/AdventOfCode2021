Repository with the solutions of Advent of Code 2021 in Kotlin.

This is my first year participating in the contest, although in many 
of the cases the solution may not be as optimal as possible, in all the 
correct solution is tried or reached.

Let this repository serve as a guide or as an example of the many solutions
that can be reached in this contest, in no case should you use the code to 
submit your own answers, however, if you want to corroborate your answers with
this code, the entries in they are in the 'inputs' package and each exercise 
(day) corresponds to a file in the 'year2021' package.

Happy coding!
